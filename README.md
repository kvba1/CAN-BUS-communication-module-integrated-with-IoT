My project harnesses the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller to interface and extract real-time data from cars. Once the data is captured, it is securely transmitted to the Azure IoT Hub. Leveraging the power of Azure, a C# IoT trigger function processes the incoming data stream. Post-processing, this data is then efficiently directed into an InfluxDB database. This system provides a seamless pipeline for automotive data, ensuring timely and reliable storage for further analytics.
